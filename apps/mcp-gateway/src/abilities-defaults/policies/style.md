- Keep functions and components small and focused; avoid deep nesting.
- Follow project code style and linters; fix warnings proactively.
- Name things clearly; prefer explicitness to cleverness.
- Document non-obvious decisions and invariants inline.
- Keep diffs small; separate refactors from behavioral changes.
